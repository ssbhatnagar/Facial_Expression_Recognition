# Facial Expression Recognition
This is a basic Facial Expression Recognition project, based on deep learning. This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network, Keras with Tensorflow backend, open CV and Flask app. The CNN uses ReLU activation function and trains grayscaled images of size 48X48. The model created is comprised of 4 convolution blocks followed by 2 fully connected layers.The objective is to classify each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories:  
<p> 0=Angry 
<p> 1=Disgust
<p> 2=Fear
<p> 3=Happy
<p> 4=Sad
<p> 5=Surprise
<p> 6=Neutral
